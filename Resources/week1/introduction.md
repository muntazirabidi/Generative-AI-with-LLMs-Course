## Introduction to the Course:

Emphasis on understanding transformer networks.

### Attention and Transformer Models:

- The transformer model was introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention is all You Need".
- The course will discuss details such as self-attention and multi-headed self-attention mechanisms.
- Transformers remain state-of-the-art despite being introduced years ago.
- The magic behind the transformer architecture is its ability to process data in parallel on modern GPUs, making it scalable.

### Depth of the Course Content:

- The course will provide a clear understanding without overwhelming learners with too much complexity.
- The content focuses on the essential aspects of the transformer architecture to ensure practical understanding and usage.

### Relevance Beyond Text:

- Although transformers are widely known for text, the architecture is also being used for vision (vision transformers).
- Understanding transformers can benefit learners in various machine learning applications.

### Generative AI Project Lifecycle:

- The course also covers the Generative AI project lifecycle to help plan and think about building personal Generative AI projects.
- Discussion on decisions, such as whether to take a foundational model off the shelf or train one's own model.
- Further discussions on model fine-tuning and customization for specific datasets.

### Choice and Size of Large Language Models:

- There's an abundance of large language model options available, leading to confusion among developers.
- Importance of evaluating and choosing the right model size for specific needs.
- Understanding that smaller models can still be powerful and effective for specific tasks.
- Larger models (with hundreds of billions of parameters) are beneficial when a general understanding of multiple topics is needed. However, smaller models can suffice for specific tasks.
