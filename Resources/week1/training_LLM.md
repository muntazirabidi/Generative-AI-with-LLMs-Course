# Training Large Language Models (LLM)

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** 
  - Access to GPUs or TPUs. Training LLMs is computationally intensive.
- **Software:** 
  - Install required packages, usually including but not limited to PyTorch or TensorFlow, and HuggingFace Transformers.

## 2. Data Preparation

- **Acquisition:** 
  - Source a sizable dataset relevant to your training objective.
- **Preprocessing:** 
  - Clean and preprocess the data. Remove anomalies, handle missing values, and possibly lower-case the text or remove special characters based on the use case.
- **Tokenization:** 
  - Convert textual data into tokens. Tokens can be as short as characters or as long as words.

## 3. Model Selection

- **Architecture Selection:** 
  - Choose an appropriate model architecture. For sequence-to-sequence tasks, models like T5 or BERT may be suitable. For text generation, GPT architectures are commonly used.
- **Pre-trained Models:** 
  - Consider starting with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on your data. This approach is usually faster and requires less data than training from scratch.

## 4. Training Configuration

- **Loss Function:** 
  - Typically, LLMs use a form of cross-entropy loss.
- **Optimizer:** 
  - Select an optimizer like Adam or AdamW. Adjust learning rates and other hyperparameters.
- **Batch Size & Sequence Length:** 
  - Choose appropriate values considering the available memory. Larger batch sizes may expedite training but require more memory.
- **Regularization:** 
  - Use techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.

## 5. Training

- **Fine-tuning:** 
  - If using a pre-trained model, fine-tune it on your dataset. This involves training the model on your data while using the pre-trained weights as a starting point.
- **Monitoring:** 
  - Monitor the training and validation loss. Over time, the model should fit better to the training data, and this should be reflected in decreasing loss values.
- **Validation:** 
  - Periodically test the model's performance on a validation set to check for overfitting.

## 6. Evaluation

- **Metrics:** 
  - Depending on the task, use relevant metrics like accuracy, F1 score, BLEU score, or perplexity to evaluate the model.
- **Baseline Comparison:** 
  - Compare the model's performance against a baseline or previously established models.

## 7. Prompt Engineering (Post-training)

- **Task Descriptions:** 
  - For certain models like T5, you might need to define the task as a prompt (e.g., "Translate English to French: {sentence}").
- **Fine-tuning with Prompts:** 
  - Use few-shot or zero-shot learning by providing explicit examples or prompts to guide the model's behavior on specific tasks.

## 8. Deployment

- **Model Compression:** 
  - LLMs are large. Techniques like quantization or pruning might be required to deploy them efficiently.
- **APIs:** 
  - Deploy the model as an API endpoint for real-time applications.

---

**Notes:**

- Training LLMs, especially from scratch, can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Fine-tuning is often a preferred strategy for new tasks.
- Regularly save model checkpoints during training to avoid data loss from unexpected interruptions.
- Experiment and iterate. Hyperparameter tuning, different architectures, and varying training data can all influence model performance.

  # FLAN-T5: An Overview

## Background
FLAN-T5, introduced in the paper **Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models**, is an enhanced iteration of the T5 model that has been fine-tuned across a variety of tasks. The model stands out for its capability to quickly adapt to a diverse range of tasks without the necessity for explicit finetuning.

## Utilizing Pre-trained FLAN-T5 Weights
Direct utilization of FLAN-T5's pre-trained weights is possible without needing any finetuning:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")

inputs = tokenizer("A step by step recipe to make bolognese pasta:", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True))
# Output: ['Pour a cup of bolognese into a large bowl and add the pasta']
```
